# MiniEncodes

I will try compiling all my scripts if possible. Feel free to use them.

üëÄ Setting up FFmpeg (and most of the other binaries you might need, like qaac, and also, ffmpegF is just the full-version of ffmpeg):
1. Download the complete package from here: [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/Jt1mRB6B#72UQtEMFATwdhsLJba7PmA)
2. Unarchive it and add the bin folder within it to PATH.

üê±‚Äçüë§ Setting up VapourSynth:
1. Download Portable VapourSynth from here: [MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/B9kABBxZ#LAztIxaWNLGR4WxRtgdqqg) 
2. Add Python38 folder from Python38.7z to C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Python/
(replace Administrator in step 2 with your username)
3. Add following locations to your PATH: [Click here](https://github.com/Soaibkhan38/MiniEncodes/blob/main/Folders%20to%20add%20to%20path%20for%20VS.txt)

ü§î Why download my VapourSynth Pack?
1. Updated with newer repos (ex. lvsfunc, vscompare, etc.)
2. Made other mods but I don't remember
