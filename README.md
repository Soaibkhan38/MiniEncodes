# MiniEncodes

I will try compiling all my scripts if possible. Feel free to use them.

Setting up VapourSynth
1. Download Portable VapourSynth from here: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EpU8QdSJl5pgoH_Q25UsghZn7NfsuLx6/view?usp=sharing) 
2. Add Python38 folder from Python38.7z to C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Python/
(replace Administrator in step 2 with your username)
3. Add following locations to your PATH: [Click here](https://github.com/Soaibkhan38/MiniEncodes/blob/main/Folders%20to%20add%20to%20path%20for%20VS.txt)

Why download my VapourSynth Pack?
1. Updated with newer repos (ex. lvsfunc)
2. Made other mods but I don't remember
